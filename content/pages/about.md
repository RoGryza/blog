title = "About Me"

I'm Rodrigo Gryzinski, I've loved programming a hobby ever since I picked it up as a teenager trying
to make games.

Over the years I've learned a lot from what others had to share online so this blog is a way to pay
it forward, I talk about what I've been tinkering with to help me reflect, to share failures and
solutions and so others can build upon it.

I deeply value open access to knowledge, original blog code and content are released to the public
domain, you may do with them as you please. I'll present an obvious disclaimer on a post when that's
not the case.

If you want to contribute something or just chat on stuff I write about feel free to get in touch
through [contact@rogryza.me].

I'm Rodrigo Gryzinski.

I'm a software developer, I consider myself a self-taught generalist and programming language nerd.

Over the years I've learned a lot from what others had to share online so this blog is a way to pay
it forward, I talk about what I've been tinkering with in my hobby projects.

title = "About Me"
+++

I'm Rodrigo Gryzinski, I'm a software engineer and love programming as a hobby, usually just as a
way to scratch an itch or satisfy my curiosity.

Over the years I've learned a lot from what others had to share online so this blog is a way to pay
it forward, I talk about what I've been tinkering with to help me reflect, to share my mistakes and
so others can build on it.

I deeply value open access to knowledge, original blog code and content are released to the public
domain, you may do with them as you please. I'll attach an obvious disclaimer to a post when that's
not the case.
